# ggplot map of USA
## with location of LHY haplotypes for Arabidopsis 1001 genome accessions

## Description
can be used to prepare a map of USA with USA Arabidopsis accessions collected by the Arabidopsis 1001 genomes project

This example: Supplemental Fig 4a of James et al. (2018) Global spatial analysis of Arabidopsis natural variants implicates 5'UTR splicing of LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL in responses to temperature. Plant Cell Environ. 41(7) 1524-38.
